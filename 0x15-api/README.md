An application program interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and
tools for building software applications. Basically, an API specifies how
software components should interact. Additionally, APIs are used when
programming graphical user interface (GUI) components. A good API makes it
easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks. A programmer
then puts the blocks together. (https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/API.html)

**What is Microservice**

Microservice architecture, or simply microservices, is a distinctive method of
developing software systems that tries to focus on building single-function
modules with well-defined interfaces and operations. The trend has grown popular
in recent years as Enterprises look to become more Agile and move towards a
DevOps and continuous testing. Microservices can help create scalable, testable
software that can be delivered weekly, not yearly.
